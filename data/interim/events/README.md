# Interim Event Tables

Event annotations that have been preprocessed (e.g., onset/offset labeling, trimming) and are ready for segmentation live here.

## File Schema

Files are Excel workbooks `{subject_id}_events.xlsx` generated by notebooks in `Analysis notebooks/001_data_preparation.ipynb`. Each sheet mirrors the columns found in the interim signal CSVs:

| Column | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `time_seconds_original_file` | float | Original Mindware timestamp for the event. |
| `MWMOBILEJ_Bio` | float | Biosignal sample value at the event boundary. |
| `MWMOBILEJ_GSC` | float | GSC sample value (present when sensor recorded). |
| `source_file_signal` | string | Source Mindware signal filename. |
| `Event Type` | string | Mindware event category. |
| `event_name` | string | Cleaned event label used by segmentation. |
| `source_file_event` | string | Source Mindware event filename. |
| `on_offset` | string | Indicates whether the row marks the event `onset` or `offset`. |
| `subject_id` | string | Participant identifier. |

Use these spreadsheets when inspecting event alignment or troubleshooting segmentation logic.
