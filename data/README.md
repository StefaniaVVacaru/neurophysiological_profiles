# Data Directory

Central hub for all project datasets. Subdirectories reflect the data lifecycle: raw Mindware exports, interim cleaned assets, processed analysis outputs, final deliverables, and behavioral measures aligned to physiological segments. Treat raw files as read-only and promote derivatives through the structure as they are generated.
