# Analysis Notebooks

This directory contains the numbered Jupyter notebooks that document the end-to-end Mindware processing workflow, from initial data preparation through ECG and EDA analyses to final dataset formatting. Execute the notebooks sequentially (`001`â€“`005`) within the project conda environment to reproduce the core analyses or to iterate on the pipeline.
